SoftEther VPN ("SoftEther" means "Software Ethernet") is one of the
world's most powerful and easy-to-use multi-protocol VPN software.

SoftEther VPN runs on Windows, Linux, Mac, FreeBSD and Solaris.

SoftEther VPN supports most of widely-used VPN protocols
including SSL-VPN, OpenVPN, IPsec, L2TP, MS-SSTP, L2TPv3 and EtherIP
by the single SoftEther VPN Server program.

  SSL-VPN (HTTPS)
  OpenVPN
  IPsec
  L2TP
  MS-SSTP
  L2TPv3
  EtherIP
- Free and open-source software.
- Easy to establish both remote-access and site-to-site VPN.
- SSL-VPN Tunneling on HTTPS to pass through NATs and firewalls.
- Revolutionary VPN over ICMP and VPN over DNS features.
- Resistance to highly-restricted firewall.
- Ethernet-bridging (L2) and IP-routing (L3) over VPN.
- Embedded dynamic-DNS and NAT-traversal so that no static nor
  fixed IP address is required.
- AES 256-bit and RSA 4096-bit encryptions.
- Sufficient security features such as logging and firewall inner
  VPN tunnel.
- User authentication with RADIUS and NT domain controllers.
- User authentication with X.509 client certificate.
- Packet logging.
- 1Gbps-class high-speed throughput performance with low memory and
  CPU usage.
- Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, iPhone, iPad and Windows Phone are
  supported.
- The OpenVPN clone function supports legacy OpenVPN clients.
- IPv4 / IPv6 dual-stack.
- The VPN server runs on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris and Mac OS X.
- Configure All settings on GUI.
- Multi-languages (English, Japanese and Simplified-Chinese).

GETTING STARTED
---------------

Visit the SoftEther VPN Project official web site at first:
        https://www.softether.org/

If you are not a developer, it is recommended to download the binary
installers from:
        https://www.softether-download.com/

To build from the source,
see "BUILD_UNIX.TXT" or "BUILD_WINDOWS.TXT" files.


HOW TO DOWNLOAD THE LATEST SOURCE CODE PACKAGE
----------------------------------------------

Go to https://www.softether-download.com/ and you can find the latest
source-code package file in both .ZIP and .TAR.GZ format.

This is the easiest way to obtain the source code of SoftEther VPN.


HOW TO GET THE LATEST SOURCE CODE TREE FOR DEVELOPERS
-----------------------------------------------------

If you are an open-source developer, visit our GitHub repository:
https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN_Stable/

You can download the up-to-date source-code tree of SoftEther VPN
from GitHub. You may make your own fork project from our project.

The download and build instruction is following:

$ git clone https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN_Stable.git
$ cd SoftEtherVPN
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install






The files here are for building an RPM package installable on CentOS 6.x/RHEL 6.x.

I (Dexter Ang, aka @thepoch) am not affiliated with the SoftEther VPN Project. Any bugs, suggestions, improvements on building an RPM should probably be reported to me.

Install and run
After the package is built and installed, you can start the service as root:

service vpnserver start
You can also have it start automatically:

chkconfig vpnserver on
Files
This project containts the following files to build an RPM of SoftEther VPN:

SPEC/softethervpn.spec - The main spec file
SOURCES/fix-makefiles.sh - Script that modifies the original makefiles so it properly makes with BUILDROOT.
linux_??bit.mak - Makefiles modified using fix-makefiles.sh. You can replace these with the original from source, and rerun the script above.
init.d/vpnserver - initscript
scripts/* - scripts that are originally generated by the original makefiles.
To Build on CentOS 6.x
As root, install the following packages:

yum -y groupinstall "Development Tools"
yum -y install ncurses-devel openssl-devel readline-devel
yum -y install rpmdevtools
As a regular user, create your rpmbuild directory structure:

rpmdev-setuptree
Copy over the files from their respective directories in this repository into your rpmbuild directory. Then

rpmbuild -ba SPECS/softethervpn.spec
The resulting RPM will be in the RPM directory. Install this as root:

rpm -Uvh RPMS/`arch`/softethervpn-4*rpm
Known Issues
Currently, vpnserver hangs when stopped on CentOS 6.5. Have not had time to debug. Ticket #18 on SoftEtherVPN SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN#18.
Directory structure retained as-is under /usr/vpn*.
Not built into separate packages (ie vpnserver, vpnclient, etc. are all in one).
When uninstalling, if you ran any of the SoftEtherVPN binaries, configuration and other files are generated in /usr/vpn*. So these directories will remain when you uninstall the RPM. You can delete these if you don't plan on using the configurations again.
Personal Notes
This is my first time creating a spec file, creating an RPM, etc. Apologies in advance for any mistakes.
This was tested using sources for version: 4.04.9412. I'll try and update this as new versions come out.
